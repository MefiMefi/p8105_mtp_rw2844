# Report

## Problem 1

First, I imported the data.

``` r
dog_weight = 
  read_excel("./data/dogweights_07sept2020.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Sheet1", range = "B2:G207", 
    col_types = c("date", "text", "text", 
        "text", "text", "text")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 
colnames(dog_weight) = c("date", "raisin", "simone", "gagne", "std", "notes")
# a missing value in date
```

In this chunk, I cleaned and manipulated the data, selected columns
except the notes, the major steps are:

  - Separate the weight data into different units(Lbs and Oz).

  - Do some calculation, generate a new variable to combine Lbs and Oz
    into one unit.

  - Make the dataset looks better using `pivot_longer`.

  - Select the variables of interest.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
dogs_df = 
  dog_weight %>%
  # Noticing that weight of 3 dogs are in two different unit, we need to split it into two columns
  separate(
    col = c("raisin"),
    into = c("raisin_lbs", "raisin_oz"),
    sep = (2)
  ) %>% 
  separate(
    col = c("simone"),
    into = c("simone_lbs", "simone_oz"),
    sep = (2)
  ) %>% 
  separate(
    col = c("gagne"),
    into = c("gagne_lbs", "gagne_oz"),
    sep = (2)
  ) %>% 
  separate(
    col = c("std"),
    into = c("std_lbs", "std_oz"),
    sep = (2)
  ) %>% 
  # change variables type
  mutate(
    raisin_lbs = as.numeric(raisin_lbs),
    raisin_oz = as.numeric(raisin_oz),
    simone_lbs = as.numeric(simone_lbs),
    simone_oz = as.numeric(simone_oz),
    gagne_lbs = as.numeric(gagne_lbs),
    gagne_oz = as.numeric(gagne_oz),
    std_lbs = as.numeric(std_lbs),
    std_oz = as.numeric(std_oz)
  ) %>% 
  # assuming that 1 lbs equals 16 oz, combine two rows
  # noticing that there is a outlier in raisin's weight(7 Lbs 15 Oz), it might be a typo, I'm gonna to fix it
  mutate(
    raisin = raisin_lbs + (raisin_oz/16),
    simone = simone_lbs + (simone_oz/16), 
    gagne = gagne_lbs + (gagne_oz/16),
    std = std_lbs + (std_oz/16),
    raisin = case_when(
      raisin >= 10 ~ raisin,
      raisin < 10 ~ raisin+10
    )
  ) %>% 
  # make the data looks better
  pivot_longer(
    raisin:std,
    names_to = "object",
    values_to = "weight_lbs"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date), object = as.factor(object)) %>% 
  # remain what we need
  select(date, object, weight_lbs)

# check for variable types
str(dogs_df)
```

    ## tibble [820 x 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    ##  $ date      : Date[1:820], format: "2018-08-12" "2018-08-12" ...
    ##  $ object    : Factor w/ 4 levels "gagne","raisin",..: 2 3 1 4 2 3 1 4 2 3 ...
    ##  $ weight_lbs: num [1:820] 19.8 10.9 10.6 NA 20.2 ...

``` r
# show the dataframe
dogs_df %>% 
  head(12) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, caption = "The weight of three dogs(Lbs), first 12 rows")
```

| date       | object | weight\_lbs |
| :--------- | :----- | ----------: |
| 2018-08-12 | raisin |       19.75 |
| 2018-08-12 | simone |       10.88 |

The weight of three dogs(Lbs), first 12 rows

In the next chunk, I am going to create a dataframe that only includes
notes and dates.

``` r
notes_df = 
  dog_weight %>% 
  select(date, notes) %>% 
  drop_na(notes)

notes_df %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Notes and dates")
```

| date       | notes                                                                         |

Notes and dates

Save these two dataframes.

``` r
write.csv(dogs_df,"./data/dogs_df.csv")
write.csv(notes_df,"./data/notes_df.csv")
```

# Problem 2

For the tidy dataset `dogs_df`, there are 820 rows and 3 variables, the
number of unique dates is 205, including 1 missing value in `date`.

``` r
dogs_df %>% 
  filter(object != "std") %>%
  # noticing that there are NA in the weight_lbs, so we cannot use summarize directly
  count(object, weight_lbs, name = "counts") %>% 
  drop_na(weight_lbs) %>% 
  group_by(object) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_obs = sum(counts),
    mean_weight = mean(weight_lbs),
    sd_weight = sd(weight_lbs)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, caption = "Summarize for the three dogs weight")
```

| object | n\_obs | mean\_weight | sd\_weight |
| :----- | -----: | -----------: | ---------: |
| gagne  |    120 |         9.83 |       0.92 |
| raisin |    202 |        18.53 |       0.85 |
| simone |    193 |        10.26 |       0.61 |
